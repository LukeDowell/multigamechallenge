# Multi Game Challenge
This is my personal attempt at creating six different games using javascript. After reading <a href="http://www.emanueleferonato.com/2010/05/07/6-games-you-must-be-able-to-make-in-less-than-a-day/">this</a> article, I decided to make a version of each of these games.
 I'll be using pixi js for each of these games.

## Concentration
	Memory game. A bunch of cards are laid down. The object of the game is to turn over matching pairs of cards. 
	Goals: Simple user-input based game. The game should update only when the player makes a choice.

## Tic Tac Toe
	Goals: Computer AI. The computer should never ever lose if done correctly.
	
## Minesweeper
	Goals: Correctly manage arrays with multiple values. The game should always be winn-able. 

## Sokoban
	The wikipedia page is located <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban">here</a>. 
	Goals: Another array game but this time you will handle keyboard interaction, and you have to be able to check for more complex rules to determine whether the player can push a box or not. Maybe make a map editor too.

## Snake
	Goals: Intro into time based updating. Make sure to check the MDN on game programming.
	
## Tetris
	Complex game. Has a little bit of everything at a basic level. Make sure you can do this one well.
